<h1>Update (V 1.5)</h1>
<p id="pastUpdates">November 24, 2020</p>
<p>Hey! A new look (and a lot more). </p>
<p><b>A lot was changed.</b> This will hopefully help. The entire website is
acessible without visiting another web address, or page. 

<br><br>

On the far right
of the window is a bar with icons; each representing different weather 
information. The home icon is your dashboard, the clock icon is hourly 
weather, and the calendar week view represents daily weather. 

<br><br>

The arrows in
a circle allow you to view the latest updates and notes. The sliders bring
you to the customize square. <b>More info below:</b></p>
<li>Content</li>
<dd> - Hourly weather is now much more robust, with hour by hour advanced
information. <b>NOTE: Most everything is able to be scrolled vertically or 
horizontally.</b>
</dd>
<li>Responsiveness</li>
<dd> - This update isn't responsive friendly, so don't be suprised if 
things aren't aligned correctly. <b>Please report any issues by emailing me at isaac@freshweather.co</b>
</dd>
<dd> - THIS UPDATE IS NOT MOBILE FRIENDLY, please don't visit it on a 
mobile device as you will see garbage. Mobile friendly is coming soon.
</dd>
